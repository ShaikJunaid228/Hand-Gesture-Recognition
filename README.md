This project focuses on creating a real-time hand gesture recognition system using computer vision and machine learning. By utilizing OpenCV for image processing and TensorFlow for model training, the system can accurately identify various hand gestures, such as thumbs up or peace signs. It is designed to be user-friendly and customizable, allowing for the addition of new gestures. The system has potential applications in touchless interfaces, gaming, and virtual controls.
